**Knowledge Graph Embedding and Similar Fact Retrieval Using TransE and TransR**

**Project Description:**
This project involves developing a custom implementation of two knowledge graph embedding techniques, TransE and TransR, to tackle key tasks in knowledge graph analysis. The objectives of the project are as follows:

**Implementation of Knowledge Graph Embeddings:**

Develop custom implementations of TransE and TransR models to generate vector embeddings for entities and relations in a knowledge graph.
1-Hop Question-Answering:

Utilize the embeddings to infer missing entities in the knowledge graph, solving 1-hop question-answering problems.
Performance Evaluation:

Compare the effectiveness of TransE and TransR models using suitable evaluation metrics to measure their performance in handling knowledge graph-based tasks.
Similar Fact Retrieval:

Design a model to identify and rank the top-5 most similar facts to a given fact, enabling fact-based similarity searches and analysis.
By integrating knowledge graph embedding techniques with real-world applications like question-answering and fact retrieval, the project aims to explore the utility and comparative performance of TransE and TransR in knowledge graph reasoning.
